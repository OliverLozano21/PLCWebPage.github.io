        <h2>The main uses of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) include a wide range of applications in industrial automation. <br>Some of the key uses are:</h2>  
        <!--Esto es una lista ordenada-->
        <ul>
            <li>Industrial Process Control: PLCs are used to control production processes in various industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and automotive. <br>These processes include ingredient mixing, temperature control, and equipment management.</li>
            <li>Machinery and Assembly Line Control: In factories and production plants, PLCs control automated machines and assembly systems, ensuring that processes are carried out efficiently and accurately.</li>
            <li>Conveyor Systems: PLCs are widely used to manage and automate conveyor systems, cranes, and product distribution systems.</li>
            <li>Building Automation and HVAC Systems: PLCs control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as lighting and other building management systems.</li>
            <li>Elevator Control Systems: In multi-story buildings, PLCs manage elevator movement, coordinating stops and ensuring safe and efficient operation.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>The importance of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) lies in their ability to significantly improve automation, efficiency, and safety in industrial environments. <br>Here are key points that highlight their importance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved Automation: PLCs automate complex processes, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing consistency and reliability in operations. <br>This leads to faster production cycles and less human error.</li>
            <li>Increased Efficiency: By controlling processes automatically and precisely, PLCs optimize energy usage, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency in manufacturing and industrial operations.</li>
            <li>Enhanced Safety: PLCs are equipped with features like fault detection, emergency stop functions, and diagnostics, which help prevent accidents and protect both operators and equipment in hazardous environments.</li>
            <li>Flexibility and Scalability: PLCs can be easily programmed and reprogrammed to adapt to changes in production needs or system requirements, making them highly flexible. <br>They are also scalable, meaning they can control everything from simple tasks to complex systems.</li>
            <li>Real-time Monitoring and Control: PLCs allow for real-time monitoring of industrial processes, enabling operators to respond to issues quickly, ensure quality control, and make adjustments as needed.</li>
